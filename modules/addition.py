#Refactor the function into multiple modules (e.g., addition.py, multiplication.py) and call them from a main script.
#Discuss why it is beneficial to organize code into modules.
#Clean Organization: Each file does one thing.
#Easier Debugging
#Reusability: You can reuse addition.py in another project.
#Different people can work on different modules-you separate responsibilities and avoid duplication
